Feedback on Thesis:

The highest score received for a thesis was 51, where you lost marks were 
in area's that were not completed or not enough written for example, 
reliability, decentralisation and developer activity.

For price history for the asset 
you are studying. Figures such as market cap, 
coin in circ, all-time high, 1 year high low are extremely 
important to be included

You need to spend more time working on analysing the decentralisation 
and consenus section of the paper, as these are key
elements to the protocol.

10 points goes for personal outlook so be sure to write a good bit here

Be sure too include graphs and images to make your thesis more interactive for the reader.

Daniel you did excellent work,  myself and Sean learned a lot from 
your analysis. If you take these modifications into account for this 
sector you will have a great chance of scooping up that prize
if you have any questions regarding this feedback, ask me anything ðŸ˜„
IMPORTANT: each metric is marked out of 5 (personal outlook 10) so be sure to have all completed


REPLY from Daniel:

Well Colm, cheers to yourself and Sean for the feedback. Very helpful and I will definitely 
take onboard the positive feedback going forward. I really enjoyed the challenge, but more so the other 
analysts thoughts and discussions hearing them speak. It would be great if we could have more people on the calls going 
forward, possibly more notification regarding when calls will happen so that people can make arrangements and organise. 
Just one element for clarification, 
could you explain to what is expected in terms of engagement / activity on the Discord channel ? Rgds, Dan
