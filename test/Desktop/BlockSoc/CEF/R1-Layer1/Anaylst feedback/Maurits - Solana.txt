Feedback on Thesis:

The highest score received for a thesis was 51.25, where you lost marks were 
lack of depth in certain metric for example, decentralisation, peer comparison and
especially personal outlook.

each metric is marked out of 5 (personal outlook 10) so it is vital that each
are filled out with detailed information to get high marks.


For price history of the asset you are studying. Figures such as market cap, 
coin in circ, all-time high, 1 year high low are extremely 
important to be included

You need to spend more time working on analysing the decentralisation 
and consenus section of the paper, as these are key
elements to the protocol.

10 points goes for personal outlook so be sure to write a good bit here

Be sure too include graphs and images to make your thesis more interactive for the reader.

Maurits you did excellent work,  myself and Sean learned a lot from 
your analysis, especially from the regulatory aspect. If you take these modifications into account for this 
sector you will have a great chance of scooping up that prize for this sector.
if you have any questions regarding this feedback, ask me anything ðŸ˜„
