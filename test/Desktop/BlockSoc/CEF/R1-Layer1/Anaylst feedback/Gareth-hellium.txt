Discord activity - 2/5

feedback on thesis:
In your thesis you had a perfect objective tone throughout which was exactly what we want too see.

The higest score recieved for a thesis was 51, where you lost marks were 
in area's that were not completed or not enough written for example, 
peer comparison, fee structure and tokenomics.


Better explanation of use cases, and indepth analysis of the decentralisation aspect.

You need to spend more time working on analysing the
decentralisation and consenus section of the paper, 
as these are key
elements to the protocol.

Peer comparison and tokenomics needs work and its
important to provide price history for the asset 
you are studying. Figures such as market cap, 
coin in circ, all-time high, 1 year high low

10 points goes for personal outlook so be sure to write a good bit here

Gareth you did excellent work, myself and Sean learned a lot from your analysis.
If you take these modifications into account for this sector you will have a great chance
of scoring much higher. 

I will make sure to give plenty of notice for the date for the presentation of this work.
if you have any questions regarding this feedback, ask me anything
