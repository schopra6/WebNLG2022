for your first analysis.


You scored one of the highest in thesis submissions with 49.5/75.
Feedback: 
Background and price history was excellent you scored full marks 
however could enhance by focusing on growth and more relevant 
technical.

For Use Cases we would like to see more of an expansion on what avax 
is.

Deeper analysis on decentralisation.

You were missing network effects section.
Important to fill out each metric as they are all individually 
marked out of 5 (besides personal outlook which is marked out of 10)

Tokenomics - more expansion needed, 
breakdown of votiing rights, distirbution of sharehoplders etc.
Rhythm you did excellent work, myself and Sean learned a lot from your analysis. 
If you take these modifications into account for this sector you will have a great chance of scooping up that prize
if you have any questions regarding this feedback, ask me anything ðŸ˜„
The grading scheme is as follows
thesis - 49.5/75

I will make sure to give plenty of notice for the date for the presentation of this work.

Thank you so much Colm for your feedback on the thesis. Glad to know that it wasn't that bad,  I'll definitely take the points into consideration.
While attempting the thesis, I did get confused about the use case, I'll try to read more about it on internet to better understand it
I would like to know if there is something specific missing in decentralisation that I can add or if you need a more general detailed answer on it?
Do you mean the content in the network effects section isn't related/appropriate or is it missing in total as I added this section and it's there ðŸ˜„
I will search more on the pointers added by you on Tokenomics
Thanks again
