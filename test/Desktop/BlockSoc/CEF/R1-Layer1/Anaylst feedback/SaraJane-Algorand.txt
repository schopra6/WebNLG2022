Feedback on thesis: It is important to provide price history for the asset you are studying. 
Figures such as market cap, coin in circ, all-time high, 1 year high low
A more in-depth explanation of how the use cases apply to your asset.
When looking at level of decentralisation it is good to provide maybe a pie chart of token distribution, 
especially if the project is run on 1 vote for each token.

For the Risks and peer comparison section you provided a great table for comparison but an explanation of 
these results are required for the reader.
Developer activity expansion on the team, what is the team doing, who is the team, what are they doing to promote/grow the crypto as well

When dealing with the consensus mechanism this is core of the assets so it's essential that it is 
explained indepth and coherently for the reader. expand on tokenomics, what can we infer from these figures??
Sara you did excellent work, myself and Sean learned a lot from your analysis. 
If you take these modifications into account for this sector you will have a great chance of scooping up that prize
