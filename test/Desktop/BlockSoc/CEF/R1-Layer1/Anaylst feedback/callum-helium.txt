Here is some Feedback on your thesis:
It is important to maintain an objective tone throughout your paper, don't let your personal preference towards
the project influence your wrting too heaviliy
What we want to see from your analysis is an overall assesment and explanation of the asset.
For next time, a coherent in-depth description of what the project does would score you higher.
This is key opening for the thesis and sets the tone for the remainder of the paper

You need to spend more time working on analysing the decentralisation and consenus section of the paper, as these are key
elements to the protocol.

Peer comparison and tokenomicsneeds work and its
important to provide price history for the asset 
you are studying. Figures such as market cap, 
coin in circ, all-time high, 1 year high low

10 points goes for personal outlook so be sure to write a good bit here
